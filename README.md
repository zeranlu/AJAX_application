# AJAX Application Project

This project required us turn an in-class build for a earbud model viewer and retrieve data from an online database using fetch().

![Novo Earbuds](images/poster.jpeg) ![Earbud Hotspots](images/hotspot.svg)

The project needed to the data of this earbud's floating hotspots dynamic pull data from https://swiftpixel.com/earbud/api/materials and https://swiftpixel.com/earbud/api/infoboxes instead of an original JS array.
